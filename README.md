# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in C.

## How to Play

1. Compile the code using a C compiler.
2. Player 1 is represented by '1', and Player 2 is represented by '2'.
3. Input the row and column numbers to place your symbol on the board.

## Rules

- Players take turns to mark a square on a 3x3 grid.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.
- If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
